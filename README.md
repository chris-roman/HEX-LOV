# ICE V: The Light of Venus

## Team

We are a team of mechatronics engineers that seeks to solve space problems, and in this competition, NASA gives us the opportunity to solve them.

We developed a Storage enery system that...****

Through a modular design, stackable, resistant to the conditions of Mars, and practical.****

We provide the solution to __________________________________*****

We approach this challenge under a modular concept, easy to implement and that compromises the crew's time as little as possible so that they can focus on their assigned tasks for the mission.****

The system has an intelligent terrarium, an intelligent power distributor and unions that allow with solar energy to have crops in production on Mars.****


## Introduction to the problem

Venus has a size, mass and internal composition similar to Earth, however, everything else that makes up this interesting planet makes reconnaissance and exploration missions impossible for researchers and scientists who seek to know more about its composition of its atmosphere and its evolution, gas composition, among others.

Space research, and therefore human curiosity, has no limits, so atmospheric, pressure and temperature conditions have not been an excuse to carry out space missions related to Venus.

Our team's challenge is to develop an energy storage system for a surface lander or a rover that stays on the surface of Venus for at least 60 days, thus providing a solution for viable long-term energy storage.

The objectives that the competition exposes us are based on selecting technologies that are consistent with the challenge, the things that we had in mind when developing the solution are the following:

- Energy storage
- Power source
- Effective applicability of the solution on venus
- Self-discharge rate
- Volume
- Dough
- Operation temperature range
- Usage of protective enclosure
- Whether the system can be recharged
- Whether the system uses in situ resources from Venus (e.g., CO2)
- Whether the system can tolerate the forces and vibrations due to launch, reentry, descent, and landing
- Whether the system can tolerate partial failure and still provide energy

## State-of-Art

Missions to venus take place since 1961 with Venera 1, however, the first mission accomplished was with Mariner 2 on December 14, 1962, acquiring data on the surface and atmosphere of venus.

One of the most important missions was that of Venera 4, it was a probe in the Soviet Venera program for the exploration of Venus. This probe consisted of a special landing module to enter the atmosphere of Venus.

This mission allowed us to learn about the temperature and atmospheric composition of Venus in a much more precise way.

Missions like this one are state of the art for this research, since although they differ from energy storage, they allow us to investigate previously proven components, such as the sodium-sulfur batteries used in the Sodium Sulfur Battery Cell Experiment (NaSBE) in 1996 through a paper published by Ford Motor Company. 

### **Automaton Rover for Extreme Environments (AREE)**

![Automaton Rover for Extreme Environments (AREE)](./images/aree.png)

NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory designed a concept of automaton rover based on 
ancient mechanical computers with modern manufacturing technology to enable the 
exploration of Venus, known for being one of the most extreme environments in 
the Solar System. <sup>[TODO](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/automaton-rover-for-extreme-environments-aree/)</sup>

AREE uses a hybrid energy storage system made up of a Composite Spring and 
Sodium Metal Chloride Batteries for the advantages that both bring since the 
automaton uses its mechanical energy supply directly to power its locomotion 
system. The instruments that cannot use mechanical energy are powered by 
batteries, which also have a greater energy density than the mechanical energy 
storage system. <sup>[TODO](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/niac_2016_phasei_saunder_aree_tagged.pdf)</sup>

Hostile Environments Resistance Batteries

## Storage and Source Selection

To promote future missions such as DAVINCI, our team set out to investigate the different types of energy storage, based on the new explorations that need to be carried out on the surface of Venus.

This research takes place on the resources provided for the competition, the experience we have accumulated participating in the previous years and the professional knowledge that we were able to apply in academic investigation.

Our investigation began with the following sections:

- Thermal batteries (mainly LiCoS2)
- Sodium-sulphur batteries
- Sodium Metal Chloride Battery
- Lithium Carbonate Battery
- Lithium sulfide batteries

Assessing the sections exposed in the competition, and the following:

- Storage Capacity energy
- Source of energy
- Rate of use
- Self-discharge rate
- Whether the system can be recharged
- Using the energy released on atmospheric entry and descent

Using the resources ****(Batteries for Venus Surface Operation and Energy Storage Technologies
for Future Planetary Science Missions) We were able to learn more about the applications and limitations of each type of battery.

Most batteries were discarded due to their inefficiency in terms of energy density compared to the others, the main comparison arose between:

A.- Lithium sulfide batteries
B.- Sodium-sulphur batteries
C.- Lithium Carbonate Battery

After further investigation of possible options, Lithium Carbonate Battery (C) was dropped due to a lack of application-related research that limits our scope and appreciation of this alternative.

Sodium-sulfur (B) batteries, due to their chemical composition, are an excellent candidate for this application, being one of the few options that have already been implemented in previous missions **** (Attach bibliography of previous missions), however, It has a lower power density than options such as lithium sulfide batteries (A) and has brittleness in the solid beta-alumina electrolyte.


Lithium sulfide batteries have been part of the biggest changes in different technological sectors in recent years, from electric vehicles, consumer electronics and space is no exception.

Later in the section on "Energy Storage Type" we will be explaining how this selection will help us effectively meet the challenge

## Materials Selection

The batteries to be used are based on Lithium-Sulfur

One of the reasons is that sulfur is an abundant element so it’s more affordable than cobalt used in Li-Ion cells. On top of that, Li-S cells are safer and more environmentally friendly. But the main advantage of this technology is the high energy density: around 5 times higher than Li-Ion cells. <sup>[TODO](https://www.e3s-conferences.org/articles/e3sconf/abs/2017/04/e3sconf_espc2017_08006/e3sconf_espc2017_08006.html)</sup>

A Lithium-Sulfur Battery (LSB) is a secondary battery composed of lithium metal anode and sulfur-based cathode.

### 1. Cathode materials

The material of excellence for this purpose is elemental sulfur due to its high theoretical specific capacity when combined with lithium, and the fact that it is very low cost and non-toxic.

### 2. Anode materials

When reacting with lithium (the anode), the sulfur prevents the formation of Li dendrites in a great extent due to the dissolved polysulfides (PS). This prevents efficiency problems.

### 3. Electrolyte

A favorable selection for electrolyte solvents is the **dimethyl ether (DME)**, and **1, 3-dioxolane (DOL)**. But its proved that the best choice is the **Lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiSO<sub>3</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>)**

### 4. Camera

Due to the extreme environment of Venus, the batteries needs to be located in a 
camera capable of resisting high temperatures, pressure, and its acidic 
atmosphere. For this task, the material selected was Inconel alloy 718, which 
is a high-strenght, corrosion resistant nickel chromium material that can be 
used at -423°F at 1300°F (commonly used for aerospace applications).
